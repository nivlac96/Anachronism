How to create a useable tile set from a sprite sheet png

1) Drag the png into this folder (Assets/Textures)
2) In Unity, select the sprite in the Project view.
3) Change settings in the inspector:
	a) Texture Type: Sprite (2D and UI)
	b) Sprite Mode: Multiple
	c) Pixels per unit: 16
	d) Compression: none
4) In the inspector, click "open sprite editor"
5) slice the tilemap in the sprite inspector:
	a) In the top left, click "Slice"
	b) In the dropdown, set "Type" to "Grid by cell size"
	c) In the dropdown, set pixel size to 16 x 16
	d) Click "Slice"
	e) close the sprite editor
6) in the inspector, click "apply"
7) to check if everything is done, in the project view, click the arrow next to thr tilemap sprite. It should expand to show all the individual sprites.
8) The spritesheet is loaded, now we must turn it into a tileset. Open the Tile Palette window if it is not open already, from Window->2D->Tile Palette in the top left of the unity editor.
9) In the tile palette, click the text in the top left just below where it says "Active Tilemap", a dropdown should appear. Select "Create New Palette".
10) In the popup, select the folder "Assets/Tilemaps/Palettes"
11) Drag your spritesheet from the project view in Assets/Textures onto the empty grid in the Tile Palette. Let it do it's thing. If it opens a file browser again, select the same folder as last time "Assets/Tilemaps/Palettes"

Once the process is done, you should be able to paint into the scene usiong your new tiles. Don't forget to save the new assets in git.
